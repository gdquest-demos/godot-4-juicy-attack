# Demo: Juicy sword attacks

This project gives an example of how to improve sword attack with layered visual effects and sound to help the player feel the weight of attacks.

<!-- TODO: check link -->
It's a follow-up demo to the [Interactions with hit and hurt boxes](https://gdquest.com/library/hitbox_hurtbox_godot4/) project.

Use it as inspiration to expand your own games, or as a learning resource to understand how to create similar effects in Godot.
